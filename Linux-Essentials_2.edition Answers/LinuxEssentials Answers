Section -4

Which of the following are Linux desktop environments? (Select all that apply.)

(A) GTK+
(B) GNOME
(C) KDE
(D) Evolution
(D) Xfce

B, C, E. GNOME, KDE, and Xfce are all Linux desktop environments.


If you want to enable one Linux computer to access files stored on another Linux computer's hard disk, which of the following network protocols is the best choice?

(A) SMTP
(B) NFS
(C) PHP
(D) DNS
(E) DHCP

B. The Network File System (NFS) was designed for exactly the task described in the question, so option B is correct. 

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) enables one computer to send email messages to another computer, so it's a poor choice for achieving the stated goal and option A is incorrect. 
The PHP: Hypertext Processor (PHP) language is used to generate dynamic content for web pages, so option C is incorrect. 
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol for delivering the mappings between hostnames and IP addresses to computers, so it won't easily achieve the stated goals, making option D incorrect.
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) enables one computer to provide network configuration information to another one over a network link, so option E is incorrect.


In which of the following languages was most of the Linux kernel written?

(A) Bash shell script
(B) Java
(C) C        ---correct
(D) C++
(E) Perl


OpenOffice.org forked from Calligra. --F 

LibreOffice forked from the pre-Apache version of OpenOffice.org in 2011. Calligra split from the KOffice office suite, which is no longer maintained.


Python is generally implemented as an interpreted language.  -T

Malicious outsiders can disrupt servers even if the computer that runs them is never broken into.  -T


SECTION 5

Which of the following commands provides the most information about your motherboard's features?	--lspci

Why might you want to partition a hard disk? (Select all that apply.)
	--To install more then one OS on the disk.  To separate filesystem data from swap space

Which of the following devices us not commonly attached via USB?
	Video monitors ---
	Scanners 
	External hard disks

	Keyboards

An Intel 64 CPU is capable of running a Linux distribution identified as
being for the AMD64 CPU.

SECTION 6

What keystroke moves the cursor to the start of the line when typing a command in Bash?
Ctrl+A

FALSE     ---Pressing Alt+F2 in the GUI brings up a text-mode display that you can
use to log in to Linux. (TRUE Version : When in X, Ctrl must be added to the VT-switching keystroke, so the correct keystroke should be Ctrl+Alt+F2 (or other function keys, through )

TRUE	  ---You can force man to display a man page in a specific section of the manual by preceding the search name with the section number, as in man 5 passwd. 
(EXplanation: When you want to override man's search order, you specify the desired manual section between man and the command name, filename, or other name on which you're searching.)

FALSE	  ---info pages are a web-based documentation format.

FALSE	  ---Linux documentation in the /usr/share/doc directory tree is almost always in OpenDocument text format.
(False. Individual program authors decide on a documentation file format based on their own specific needs and preferences. Although some documents are in OpenDocument Text format, many documents are not.)

Each document in an info page is known as a(n) NODE.

The LOCATE command searches a database of filenames, enabling you to identify files quickly whose names match a term that you specify.

SECTION 7

1-  Which of the following commands would you type to rename newfile.txt to
afile.txt ?
A. mv newfile.txt afile.txt

2-  You want to copy a directory, MyFiles , to a USB flash drive that uses the FAT filesys-
tem. The contents of MyFiles are as follows:
$ ls -l MyFiles/
total 276
-rw-r–r– 1 jen users 129840 Nov 8 15:13 contract.odt
-rw-r–r– 1 rod users 42667 Nov 8 15:12 outline.pdf
-rw-r–r– 1 sam users 105979 Nov 8 15:12 Outline.PDF
The USB flash drive is mounted at /media/usb , and so you type cp -a MyFiles/
/media/usb . What problem will occur when you attempt to copy these files?

A. The command will fail because it tries to create links.
B. The MyFiles directory will be copied, but none of its files will be copied.
C. One file will be missing on the USB flash drive.
D. One file’s name will be changed during the copy.
E. Everything will be fine; the command will work correctly.

C. Because two files (outline.pdf and Outline.PDF) have names that differ only in case, and because FAT is a case-insensitive filesystem, one of those files will be missing on the copy. (Both files will be copied, but the second one copied will overwrite the first.) Thus option C is correct.

SECTION 8

Which of the following commands will print lines from the file world.txt that contain matches to changes and changed?

A) grep change[ds] world.txt ++

B) tar change[d-s] world.txt

C) find "change'd|s'" world.txt

D) cat world.txt changes changed

E) find change[^ds] world.txt

A. The grep utility finds matching text within a file and prints those lines. It accepts regular expressions, which means that you can place in brackets the two characters that differ in the words for which you're looking


Which of the following redirection operators appends a program's standard output to an existing file without overwriting that file's original contents?

A) |

B) 2>

C) &>

D) >

E) >>


E. The >> operator appends standard output to a file, so option E is correct


You've received a tar archive called data79.tar from a colleague, but you want to check the names of the files it contains before extracting them. Which of the following commands would you use to do this?

A) tar uvf data79.tar

B) tar cvf data79.tar

C) tar xvf data79.tar

D) tar tvf data79.tar

E) tar Avf data79.tar

D. With the tar utility, the --list (t) command is used to read the archive and display its contents. The --verbose (v) option creates a verbose file listing, and --file (f) specifies the filename—data79.tar in this case. 

True/False
* The regular expression Linu[^x].*lds matches the string Linus Torvalds. 
True. The special characters [^x] match any single character except x, and .* matches any sequence of any characters. The string Linus Torvalds is just one of many strings to match the specified regular expression.

* The find command enables you to locate files based on their sizes.
True. You can use the -size n option in the find command to locate files based on their sizes.

* To compress files archived with zip, you must use an external compression program such as gzip or bzip2 in a pipeline with zip.
False. The zip utility creates or manipulates zip archive files. This file type supports compression directly, as does the zip program. Thus there's no need to involve another compression program to compress files archived with zip.

* The character that represents the start of a line in a regular expression is ________^_____.

* The _____cut________ command can extract specified data fields from a file's records.

* Complete the following command to redirect both standard output and a standard error from the bigprog program to the file out.txt.

$__&>___ bigprog out.txt

*The gzip, bzip2, and xz programs all perform ___lossless___ compression, in which the uncompressed data exactly matches the original precompression data.

SECTION 9 -NOTES

* two package systems, RPM and Debian, are common (although others exist as well).

* The Linux kernel l is the core of a Linux installation. The kernel manages memory, provides software with a way to access the hard disk, doles out CPU time, and performs other critical low-level tasks. The kernel is loaded early in the boot process, and it’s the kernel that’s responsible for managing every other piece of software on a running Linux computer.

* The init process is then responsible for starting all the other basic programs that Linux must run, such as the programs that manage logins and always-up servers

* Before you can manage processes, you must be able to identify them. The ps and top utilities can help you identify processes. In either case, you can search for processes in various ways, such as by  ame or by resource use. You may also want to identify how much memory your processes are consuming, which you can do with the free command.

* typing ps ax usually produces the desired information

* Although ps can return process priority and CPU use information, the program’s output is usually sorted by PID number, and it provides information at only a single moment in time.

* top sorts its entries by CPU use, and it updates its display every few seconds.

* The top command shows system summary information and information about the most CPU-intensive processes on a computer.

* Many programs that run in the background (daemons) write information about their normal operations to log files , which record such notes. Consulting log files can therefore be an important part of diagnosing problems with daemons.

* LOG is the file extension for an automatically produced file that contains a record of events from certain software and operating systems. While they can contain a number of things, log files are often used to show all events associated with the system or application that created them. For example, your backup program might keep log files showing exactly what happened (or didn’t happen) during a backup. Windows keeps all kinds of log files for its various services.

* Linux stores most log fi les in the /var/log directory tree.

* Not all programs log messages. Typically, only daemons do so; ordinary user programs display error messages in other ways—in GUI dialog boxes or in a text-mode terminal.

* The kernel ring buffer is something like a log file for the kernel; however, unlike other log files, it’s stored in memory rather than in a disk file. Like regular log files, its contents continue to change as the computer runs.

What is the usual name for the first process that the Linux kernel runs, aside from itself?
A. init ++
B. bash
C. cron
D. login
E. grub


Which of the following tools is best suited to installing a software package and all its dependencies on a Debian computer?

E. apt-get

Where do most log files reside on a Linux computer?

A. /var/log

* By default, the first process listed in top is currently consuming the most CPU time. --- TRUE

* The dmesg command may produce different output after a computer has been running for weeks after it first started ---TRUE

* Most Linux distributions maintain information on what packages are installed in the ___package database__ (two words)

* You’re using bash , and you type emacs to launch the emacs editor. In this case, emacs is bash ’s ___child__

* General system messages are likely to be found in /var/log/messages or /var/ log/_syslog__ , depending on your distribution.

SECTION 10

* For which type of file is nano least likely to be useful for examining or editing?

-> A LibreOffice word processing document

* Which keystrokes invoke the pico or nano search function? 

-> F6 , Ctrl-W

* How would you remove two lines of text from a file when using vi ?

-> In command mode, position the cursor on the first line and type 2dd.

* Unicode is useful for encoding most European languages but not not Asian languages. ->FALSE

* GUI text editors for ASCII are superior to text-mode ASCII text editors because the GUI editors support underlining, italics, and multiple fonts. -> FALSE

* If you have never used a text editor before, the nano text editor is usually the best one to learn first. -> TRUE

* ASCII supports _128_ unique characters (not including control characters).

* Three keystrokes that can initiate a search-and-replace operation in nano are F14,Ctrl+\ and  Esc+R

* While in vi's command mode, you can type __u_ to undo a change.

* To save a file and exit the vi text editor in command mode, type __ZZ__
